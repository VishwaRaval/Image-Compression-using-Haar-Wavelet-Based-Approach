# Image-Compression-using-Haar-Wavelet-Based-Approach
In the course of MAT204: Linear Algebra, I along with my group partners explored the issue of low complex 2D Image Compression using the Haar Wavelets as the basis function, and also calculated the quality of compressed images using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) factor.
